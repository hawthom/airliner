The heading module exposes the Direction enum, and the Heading and HeadingRange
classes.

Enums:
    Direction  Specify a preferred direction in Heading operations.

Classes:
    Heading  Subclass of float bounded [0, 360). Arithmetic automatically wraps.
    HeadingRange  Defines a space between two Headings that it `contains`.
