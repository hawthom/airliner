    A Sensor is a long-running passive component of Pyliner.

    An app may be attached or detached at any time by the program. In the event
    that an app is detached, it should cease any auxiliary tasks by stopping
    threads or disabling event listeners.

    A app is given an AppAccess token when it is attached. This token is how
    the app broadcasts and receive intents from the vehicle it is attached to.

    Apps should be responsive. They can register for telemetry events and
    receive intents from other apps.

    If an app requests control of the vehicle it must wait until such control is
    granted before and commands that it sends are accepted.
