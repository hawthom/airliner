 *
 * Defines constant configuration structures and pointers that link together
 * the CFE core, PSP, OSAL.  The content of these configuration structures
 * can be used to avoid directly using #include to reference a function
 * implemented in another library, which can greatly simplify include paths
 * and create a more modular build.
